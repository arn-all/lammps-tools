# Mixing Geometries

A simple script to create an hybrid configuration for a system of which two states are known.
The resulting file(s) are composed of two regions, where atoms positions are taken from the state A or B.
A buffer region can be created. 

## Motivation

A motivation for this is the creation of a kink-pair nucleation pathway for NEB as described in [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/THESES_LYON1/tel-03728547v1) :
